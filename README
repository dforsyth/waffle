Waffle is a distributed graph processing framework based on Google's Pregel
paper.

The base distribution for Waffle is barebones.  For some useful addons check
out www.github.com/dforsyth/syrup.

STATUS:
	Currently Waffle jobs must be manually deployed and started.

NOTE:
	Waffle is not production ready and is under heavy development.  I have no
	intention of maintaining a backwards compatible API at this point, so use
	at your own risk!

	Better errors/error handling (or any error handling for that matter)
